# Data-Structures-2023
**Lab 6**

 - Data structures and algorithm module provides this lab to implement a stack using an array and a linked list .
 -  Main task is to compare the run time of these two tasks and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of implementing a stack by using array and linked list.
 
 
 
 - [ ] Implement the stack by array using given example in the lab .Then checking the run time inserting random values to the stack according to the given stack size.
 - [ ] Implement the stack by singly linked list using given example in the lab .Then checking the run time inserting random values to the stack according to the given stack size.


**Lab 7**

-In lab7 ,we assigned to implement the insertion and deletion operations of binary search tree. For the given inputs , we have to traverse through the tree and outputs the elements in binary search tree. 
User has to input the assigned operation number and the key value. 

 

 - operation 1 - insertion
 - operation 2 - deletion
 - -1  Exit
