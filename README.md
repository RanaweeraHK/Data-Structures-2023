# Data-Structures-2023
**Lab 6**

 - Data structures and algorithm module provides this lab to implement a stack using an array and a linked list .
 -  Main task is to compare the run time of these two tasks and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of implementing stack by using array and linked list.
 
 
 
 - [ ] Implement the stack by array using given example in the lab .Then checking the run time inserting random values to the stack according to the given stack size.
 - [ ] Implement the stack by singly linked list using given example in the lab .Then checking the run time inserting random values to the stack according to the given stack size.
