# Data-Structures-2023
**Lab 6**

 - Data structures and algorithm module provides this lab to implement a stack using an array and a linked list .
 -  Main task is to compare the run time of these two tasks and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of implementing a stack by using array and linked list.
 
 
 
 - [ ] Implement the stack by array using given example in the lab .Then checking the run time inserting random values to the stack according to the given stack size.
 - [ ] Implement the stack by singly linked list using given example in the lab .Then checking the run time inserting random values to the stack according to the given stack size.


**Lab 7**

- In lab7 ,we assigned to implement the insertion and deletion operations of binary search tree. For the given inputs , we have to traverse through the tree and outputs the elements in binary search tree. 
User has to input the assigned operation number and the key value. 

 

 - operation 1 - insertion
 - operation 2 - deletion
 - -1  Exit
 
**Lab 8**

 - In this lab , we were assigned to complete the heap sort algorithm.
 - The input size and the elements of the array gets from the user and  outputs the sorted array as comma separated values.
 - In the code heapify() function is used to convert the elements into a heap using recursion.
 - The function heapSort() sorts the array elements using heap sort. It starts from the non-leaf nodes and calls the heapify() on each of them. This converts the array into a binary max heap.

**Lab 9**


This lab is based on hash tables. We implemented a password look up system using hash tables. We first implemented hash table without chaining and then imported a linkedList.cpp  and implemented hash table with chaining.
User can do 4 main tasks by using this password lookup system.

 1. Insert - inserting an username and password to the system.
 2. Delete - deleting existing user profile in the system
 3. Print Hash lookup password
 4. Print hash table
